My name is Seungryeol (Jake) Tae, and I am currently a junior pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering. My primary interests lie in Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices and Robotics, with a particular focus on microfabrication, device modeling, and control theory. I possess a solid foundation in both microelectronics and control systems, enabling me to contribute effectively to interdisciplinary projects, ranging from embedded control system design to CMOS device and process modeling for microfabrication.

I am committed to continuous learning, actively engaging in advanced courseworks & workwhops while expanding my skills through independent projects and work experiences. In my free time, I work with Arduino and other microcontrollers to further develop my technical expertise and practical problem-solving abilities.

I invite you to explore this website to learn more about my academic background, project work, and curriculum vitae. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or opportunities for collaboration.
