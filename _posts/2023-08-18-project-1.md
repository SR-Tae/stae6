This is my first Arduino project, where I built a robot arm that moves based on hand gestures. It uses an **MPU-6050 accelerometer** and a **flex sensor** to control four servo motors:

- Three servos at the base move the arm in the X, Y, and Z directions.
- The fourth servo opens and closes the gripper.

The MPU-6050 is attached to a glove to track the handâ€™s tilt and angle, moving the arm in the same direction. The flex sensor sits on the index finger and controls the gripper depending on how much the finger bends. Most of the work went into fine-tuning the sensors and motors for smooth operation with minimal noise.
