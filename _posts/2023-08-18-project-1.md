This is my first Arduino project, where I built a robot arm that moves based on hand gestures. It uses an MPU-6050 accelerometer and a flex sensor to control four servo motors. Three of the servos at the base move the arm in the X, Y, and Z directions, while the fourth one opens and closes the gripper. The MPU-6050 is attached to a glove to track the handâ€™s tilt and angle, which then moves the arm in the same direction. The flex sensor sits on the index finger and makes the gripper open or close depending on how much the finger bends. Most of the work went into fine-tuning the sensors and motors so they work smoothly without too much noise. (3D model is from EEZYbotARM)
